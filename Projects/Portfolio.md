You'll conduct several hypothesis tests using Python to determine if the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant. You'll also check if factors such as age significantly influence the adverse reactions.

The model should assist in identifying which debts are worth pursuing based on factors like the expected vs. actual recovery amount, the applied recovery strategy, and demographic variables (age, sex).

It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels

The goal is to use this information to predict PM2.5 particulate matter concentration (a common measure of air quality that normally requires ground-based sensors to measure) every day for each city. The data covers the last three months, spanning hundreds of cities across the globe.

In addition, the model will contribute to a body of work ensuring that Swahili is represented in apps and other online products in future.

This will be used to develop a tool that can crop a given image to show only the important facial region, reducing the chances of an accidental match down the line.

The machine learning solution will help policymakers, law enforcement, hospitals, and even commercial businesses ensure that masks are being worn appropriately in public. These solutions can help in the battle to reduce community transmission of COVID-19.

Dry river beds, railway tracks and power lines could look like roads. This will allow government officials to focus on areas they might need to send an official to confirm the road placement, and add it to the government’s maps and road networks.

By knowing what type of damage a crop experiences, images can be fed into a model to indicate whether a crop was damaged, and needs to be evaluated for insurance payouts.
